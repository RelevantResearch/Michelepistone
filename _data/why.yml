  quote: "VIISTA’s energy and commitment to humanity is palpable. I haven’t met other students in person, but I feel connected to them in a way that I never thought an online program could accomplish. I understand–in fact, I feel–the issues of immigration advocacy so much more deeply than I expected to. I expected legal training; I got something much, much bigger. I got a whole new way to look at the world."

    description: >
      Everyone confronting our immigration system deserves an advocate. 
      But as many as 60% of all migrants – many of whom are children – contend with our legal system without a representative by their side. 
      The consequences of this are substantial; 
      <a href="https://www.vera.org/state-of-justice-reform/2019/immigration-enforcement" target="_blank">Vera Institute</a> found that migrants with a representative are 10 times more likely to secure relief. 
      And with a backlog of more than 1.2 million pending cases our challenge is simple and urgent: we need more advocates.
