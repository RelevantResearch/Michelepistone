  description: "For decades, legal education has focused on teaching. Let’s focus on student learning."
  statistics_paragraph: "For law to meet the needs of society, more students from diverse backgrounds need to learn the law and find career paths within the legal services industry. Backed by a curriculum that is student-centered, holistic, and aligned with practical, on-the-job tasks we can build new models for providing legal services. And with education that is online and scalable, we can ensure that every person confronting the justice system has an advocate."

  quote: "Michele’s Bootcamp on designing a law course was an amazing resource and experience. I'm sure that it will become a required task for all professors intending to teach online (in fact it should be required whether the professor is teaching online or in-person). Too much teaching is still being done without any understanding of pedagogy."
