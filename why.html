I haven’t met other students in person, but I feel connected to them in a way that I never thought an online program could accomplish. I understand–in fact, I feel–the issues of immigration advocacy so much more deeply than I expected to. I expected legal training; I got something much, much bigger. I got a whole new way to look at the world."

                <h1>Become an Immigrant Advocate</h1>
                <h2 class="h3-style">The Opportunity</h2>
                <p class="advocate">Everyone confronting our immigration system deserves an advocate. But as many as 60% of all migrants – many of whom are children – contend with our legal system without a representative by their side. The consequences of this are substantial; <a href="https://www.vera.org/state-of-justice-reform/2019/immigration-enforcement" target="_blank">The Vera Institute</a> found that migrants with a representative are 10 times more likely to secure relief. And with a backlog of more than 1.2 million pending cases our challenge is simple and urgent: we need more advocates.</p>
                <h2 class="h3-style">Our Model</h2>
                <p class="advocate">By focusing on the diverse set of immigrant-serving professionals, activists, students and volunteers passionate about our cause and training them to effectively represent immigrants, we can transform the legal landscape. VIISTA (Villanova Interdisciplinary Immigration Studies Training for Advocates) represents the cutting-edge in immigration law education and practices, delivered in a program that is:</p>

                <div class="label2">Fully modular and online</div>
                <p class="labelp">Designed to meet individual students’ experience level and schedules in 10-15 hours per week.</p>
                <div class="label2">Affordable</div>
                <p class="labelp">Building skills in immigrant advocacy and accompaniment and the practical training required to handle cases professionally for less than $4,000 in tuition.</p>
                <div class="label2">Interdisciplinary and community-driven</div>
                <p class="labelp">Focused on what members of the immigration ecosystem told us are most important for new advocates to know and be able to do and building a portfolio of professional memos and experience that demonstrate learning.</p>
                <p class="advocate">We designed the VIISTA curriculum around actionable learning goals and assessment tools that reflect real legal work. Learning activities journey students through the legal case planning process so students see the relevance of each activity and its applicability to real life practice.</p>
                <p class="advocate">Advocates complete our program ready to handle cases and change outcomes for immigrant families by building new skills and capacities in each Module.</p>
