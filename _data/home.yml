  title: "A NEW MODEL FOR TEACHING THE LAW"
  subtitle: "Pistone’s instructional design creates a new way to train the advocates needed to expand access to justice."
  paragraphs:
    - "It’s time to make legal education work for the diverse students, advocates, and professionals ready to transform our system – and for the thousands of people currently denied access to justice each year."
    - "By redesigning our curriculum to connect topics in the law with practical skills, we can revolutionize our field."
    - "Student-centered course design starts with students’ goals: what they value, need to know, and want to do in their lives and careers. With that understanding in mind, we can design a curriculum that specifically teaches to those articulated and vetted learning goals. All the course content and learning activities create opportunities for student learning when students put that knowledge to work through active, problem-based learning. As students actively engage in learning, they demonstrate whether they met the goals and receive feedback that supports further learning."
